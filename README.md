# HEIMDALL VALIDATOR #

Avoid unwanted data in your project with Heimdall Validator.

Heimdall Validator was inspired by Laravel and Symfony validators. It receives an associative array with data and another associative array with the desired validation rules.

This package will not throw exceptions or block any request; instead, it returns an associative array containing a boolean indicating whether the data is valid, along with another associative array containing error messages for any invalid data, you will see examples below.
